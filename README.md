Flask Challenge - April 2013
============================

A challenge for those who took part in the Flask Workshop at CoderDojo April
2013

So, now you've learnt the basics of how to use Flask, it's time to put those
skills to good use.

Your challenge is to produce a simple Message Board webapp that allows people
to log in and post messages. You'll need a few pages:

* Home
* Register
* Log In
* Log Out
* View Messages
* Add message

I suggest you use Flask and SQLAlchemy (since that's what I know how to use),
but you don't have to. You might want to look up bcrypt for password security.

Whilst I won't be at the next CoderDojo, that will be the due date for the
challenge. I'll be marking the submissions, and hopefully I'll be able to get
some form of prize. Feel free to team up with other people.

I'll be judging on how much you've done, a little bit of how neat your code
is, and generally how well the app works.

Bonus points will be given for the following extension tasks:

* User Profiles (including editing)
* Formatting and Smileys in messages
* Multiple message boards

Taking Part
-----------

If you're proficient enough in git, you can fork this repository, write your
code and submit a pull request. If you've no idea what I just said, you can
just write your code and email it to me at sl <at> toastwaffle <dot> com.

I look forward to seeing your submissions
